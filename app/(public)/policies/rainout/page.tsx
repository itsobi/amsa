        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">1. Purpose.</span> The purpose of this
          policy is to strike a balance between the need to maintain fields in
          good condition over the long-term, and the desirability to play
          matches when scheduled.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">2. Decision-Maker.</span> Decisions
          about field playability at the Onion Creek Soccer Complex (OCSC) shall
          be made, after consultation with the field facilitator, by the Field
          Commissioner or the AMSA President, if the Field Commissioner is
          unavailable, or another person designated by the AMSA President. The
          decision-maker shall be someone who is familiar with soccer field
          usage and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">3. Timing.</span> The initial decision
          shall be made no later than 6:45 AM on the day in question, except
          that the decision may be made as of 5:00 PM on the day before
          match-day, if the fields are so wet that it is certain that they will
          be unplayable on match-day. (It is important to make the decision
          based on conditions as they actually exist on the match day itself,
          rather than based on a weather forecast or a guesstimate. It is
          important to make the decision as early as possible on match-day, so
          as to give as much notice as possible to players and referees.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">4. Method.</span> It will be the
          responsibility of the OCSC Field Facilitator to actually walk each
          field to determine if the field is playable according to the
          guidelines in the next section. (It is important to base the decision
          on personal observation, rather than assumptions, guesstimates or
          second-hand information.) Based on the guidelines, if the Facilitator
          determines any of the OCSC fields are unplayable, he/she will contact
          the decision-maker to inform him about the status of the fields.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">5. Guidelines.</span> Matches shall be
          postponed on a given field if, on a significant portion of the field,
          there is standing water on the field or the turf is “squishy” when
          walked upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">6. Re-Evaluation.</span> If a field is
          not playable under the guidelines, but there appears to be a
          reasonable possibility that the field may be playable later in the
          day, only the morning matches shall be cancelled initially, and the
          field shall be re-evaluated by the OCSC Field Facilitator at 10:30 AM
          for afternoon play.
        </p>

        <p>
          <span className="font-semibold">
            7. Notification of Players and Referees.
          </span>{' '}
          The decision-maker or the AMSA Administrator shall record an
          appropriate message on the appropriate rain-out number IMMEDIATELY
          after the fields have been examined by the Field Facilitator. The
          message should begin with the date and time of the message. If fields
          are playable, the message should so state, especially if there has
          been rain in the area recently. The message should conclude by stating
          the time of the next announcement, if re-evaluation is contemplated.
          Notice shall also be posted at the entrance to the field complex.
        </p>

          <span className="font-semibold">
            8. Declaring Rainout After Play Commences.
          </span>{' '}
          If after play has commenced, field conditions deteriorate to the point
          where the Guidelines set forth above are met, teams are expected to
          halt play. In addition, any member of the Executive Committee, Referee
          or Referee Coordinator who is present at the fields has the authority
          to halt play. The person(s) making the decision shall put in place a
          “Fields Closed” sign at the entrance to the complex, and he shall
          notify the Field Commissioner or the President so that the rainout
          phone message may be updated.

            9. Penalty for Playing After Rain-out Declared.
          </span>{' '}
          If a field at Onion Creek or any other field used by AMSA has been
          declared “rained out” or closed, no AMSA teams or players may play on
          that field. Any team or individual player who plays in violation of
          this policy shall be subject to the penalties set forth in AMSA Rule
          5.4.C. Creek or any other field used by AMSA has been declared “rained
          out” or closed, no AMSA teams or players may play on that field. Any
          team or individual player who plays in violation of this policy shall
          be subject to the penalties set forth in AMSA Rule 5.4.C.
