        <p>
          The Austin Men&apos;s Soccer Association (&quot;AMSA&quot;) has the
          primary right to use the Onion Creek Soccer Complex (&quot;OCSC&quot;)
          under a Use Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) with the City of Austin.
          The Agreement runs for a period of twenty-five (25) years, through May
          27, 2029, plus two ten-year options-to-renew. AMSA also has the
          obligation to maintain the OCSC fields during the term of the
          Agreement.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following policies shall guide the use of the fields. Applicable
          provisions of the Agreement are cited in brackets throughout this
          Policy. All such provisions are contained in Section VII of the
          Agreement. All references to &quot;PARD&quot; denote the Parks and
          Recreation Department of the City of Austin.
        </p>

          <h6 className="font-semibold">I. Use by AMSA Membership.</h6>
          <div className="pl-2 space-y-6">
            <p>
              A. Scheduled Use. OCSC fields are available for
              regularly-scheduled use by member-teams, either in league or
              tournament competition. The fields may not be used for practice or
              informal play by either member-teams or member-individuals, except
              as specifically permitted in other formal written policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              B. No Use After Cancellation. No member-team or member-individual
              may use a field if their regularly-scheduled match has been
              rained-out or cancelled for any reason. (This policy shall not
              apply to forfeited matches or matches without referees, which are
              governed by other policies.)

          <h6 className="font-semibold">II. Balancing Maintenance and Play.</h6>
          <div className="pl-2 space-y-6">
            <p>
              A. Overall Policy. Although AMSA&apos;s primary purpose is to
              provide soccer play for its membership, AMSA shall strive to
              maintain the fields in good condition at all times. It is
              important to strike a balance between the need to maintain the
              fields in good condition over the long-term, and the desirability
              to play matches when scheduled.
            </p>
            <p>
              B. Cancellation of AMSA Matches. In the event of rain, snow or
              flood, matches involving AMSA member-teams shall be cancelled in
              accordance with AMSA&apos;s Rain-Out Policy, if a field has
              standing water or is squishy. Any decision to cancel a match shall
              be made by the officials, and according to the procedures, as set
              forth in AMSA&apos;s Rain-Out Policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              C. Cancellation of Activities Involving AMSA Sub-Lessees. From
              time-to-time, AMSA intends to sub-lease the fields to other teams
              and organizations (&quot;sub-lessees&quot;). With respect to an
              activity or match involving AMSA&apos;s sub-lessees, AMSA may
              cancel the same at any time when it appears that permitting play
              may cause damage to the field. Any decision to cancel shall be
              made by the officials authorized to do so under AMSA&apos;s
              Rain-Out Policy, free of any other restriction in said policy.

              obliged to request these dates 120 days in advance, but AMSA is

              a. Soccer and Non-Soccer Activities. Priority should be given to
              soccer activities over non-soccer activities. In general,
              non-soccer activities are not favored. No non-soccer activity
              shall be allowed if there is a reasonable likelihood that it would
              have a negative impact on the fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              b. Tournament and League Play. Priority should be given to

            </p>
            <p>
              c. Youth and Adult Users. Priority should be given to youth

            <p>
              a. Amount of User Fees. User fees may be &quot;no greater than the
              current fees then charged by PARD for similar use.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>
              b. Schedule of User Fees. AMSA shall propose a schedule of fees to
              PARD, and PARD shall not unreasonably withhold its approval.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Tournament Fees, Donations and Fund-Raising. AMSA may also
              charge fees for tournaments, solicit donations and raise funds
              through other means, so long as AMSA applies the funds to
              maintenance of the fields. [Subsec. C-5]

            <p>

            <p>

            <p>
              D. Re-Scheduling AMSA Member-Teams. AMSA member-teams have first
              right of use for league and tournament play. AMSA shall not
              sub-lease a field that has been previously scheduled for AMSA
              member-teams, unless AMSA can provide another field of similar
              quality on the same date.

            </p>
            <p>
              a. Preservation of Fields. In the event a field deteriorates to
              the point where continued play is reasonably likely to cause
              serious damage, a moratorium in scheduling may be declared, and
              matches already scheduled may be re-scheduled.
            </p>
            <p>

              schedule is subject to PARD approval, &quot;which shall not be

              with a schedule of their use no later than twenty-eight (28) days
              in advance of the commencement of league or tournament play, or
              upon the date that AMSA grants them the right to use the fields,
              whichever comes later.
