# Austin Men's Soccer Association (AMSA) Website Rewrite

A modern, sleek, rewrite of [Austin Men's Soccer Association Website.](https://austinmenssoccer.com/)

p.s. I actually happen to play in this league, and got tired of the experience when I would check the game times/scores, so I decided to rewrite the website myself. Cheers üçª.
